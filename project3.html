                <p>Observed and interviewed real users interacting with an interface,
                    created personas based on these users,
                    and illustrated a storyboard for one of the personas. </p>
                 <hr class="m-5"/>
                 <h2 id="intro">Preparation</h2>
                 <p>The interface I chose to create my personas and storyboard for was the self-checkout kiosk at Ten One Tea House:</p>
                 <img id="kiosk-sketch" src="resources/kiosk sketch.jpg"/>
                 <figcaption class="text-center"> Fig. 1. Sketch of Snackpass Self-Order Kiosk </figcaption>
                 <p class="mt-3">This Snackpass Self-Order Kiosk at Ten One Tea House allows customers a faster alternative to order their drinks or pastries without the help of an employee.
                    Customers can navigate through the menu using the touch screen display. Once they are ready to pay, they can simply insert or tap their card on the provided 
                    scanner located directly beneath the screen.</p>
                <hr class="m-5"/>
                <h2>Observations & Interviews</h2>
                <p> 
                    Overall, users seemed to interact very easily with the kiosk. They were able to quickly and without great
                    difficulty navigate through the menu, find their desired item, and pay using a credit card. The only time that 
                    users seemed to hesitate was in finding the credit card swiper, but it only took a second or two until they 
                    realized that it was located directly below the screen. 
                </p>    
                <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                    <ol>
                        <li> What made you choose to order from the kiosk as opposed to the counter? <br>
                            > It's usually faster, more efficient, and I can track the cost more easily.
                        </li>
                        <li> What was your goal with the kiosk, and did you achieve it? <br>
                            > All users said their goal was to order a drink for a good price, and they were easily able to do so. 
                        </li>
                        <li> How did the time you took to use the kiosk compare to your expectations for how long it would take? <br>
                            > Users said it either took as much time as expecting or less.
                        </li>
                        <li> Were there any positive or negative surprises when using this kiosk? <br>
                            > Users were mainly surprised that it was so easy. One user noted that the ability to earn 
                            Snackpass points was a pleasant surprise. 
                        </li>
                        <li> Next time you order from Ten One, would you use this kiosk or the counter to order and why? <br>
                            > Would probably use the kiosk again because it was easier, faster, and could track cost, but if there was a line to the kiosk <br>
                            and no one line to the counter, they would go to the counter.
                        </li>

                <h2>Personas</h2>
                <p>I then created these personas based off of my observations:</p>

                                <li>Fast Fred doesn't want to wait for a long time in line, and there is no line to the kiosk. </li>
    
                                <li>Fast Fred finds that he is able to easily find exactly what he'd like to order via the kiosk and check out

                                <li>Fast Fred represents the majority of users since most people choose to use the kiosk as a faster alternative to
